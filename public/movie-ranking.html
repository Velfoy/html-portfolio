<h1>The Best doramas according to Lera's opinion</h1>
<h2>My top 3 of all time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Vincenco</h3>
<p>It is one of my favorite doramas of all time.When I was watching it I literally was having a goosebamps.Perfect actors , one of the best vilians, interaction of actors.Every single episode is keeping you in suspense</p>
<h3>Happiness</h3>
<p>If you think it's about happiness , you are totally wrong.It is about zomby and people who try to survive, when around is people and something what you cant name a people ,not becase of virus , because of human soul of every person that apear in dorama.But also you can find romance in two people who try to survive in this awful place.</p>
<h3>Reborn Rich</h3>
<p>Only by name of this dorama, you can undedrstand what is going on in this series. It was love for the first sight.It was perfect, everething I have ever wanted. Reincarnation and the main hero is using knowledge of the future to gain everything he have ever wanted . Also he has become grandson of the richest man in Korea, but to inherit bisuness he must become the best among other family members. </p>
<h4>"Again my life" , I don't know how I forgot about this kdrama but it is dorama which i was watching uncountable amount of time</h4>
